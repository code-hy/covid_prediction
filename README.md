# 🦠 COVID-19 Historical Case Prediction API

## 🎯 Problem Description
In any pandemic situation, government public health agencies need reliable short-term forecasts of covid-19 disease cases to allocate resources. However, forecasting into the unknown future is unverifiable.  

This project **predicts daily new COVID-19 cases for historical dates (up to August 2024)** using only data available before that date, as the data is no longer kept-up-date.
Because actual values are known, we can **validate model accuracy transparently** — enabling honest assessment of predictive performance.  

The solution is a REST API that returns:
- Predicted case count based on given date prior to August 2024
- Actual reported value (for verification)
- Confidence in trend (via binary classification)

Use cases:  for any prediction of infectious disease given enough data, for public health education

## 📥 Data
We use the [Our World in Data (OWID) COVID-19 dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data), last updated August 2024.  The raw dataset is in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv


✅ **No need to commit large CSV** — data is downloaded automatically during training.

To download manually:
```bash
curl -L "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv" -o data/owid-covid-data.csv
```
